When to Squash Commits?
Simply put, we use squashing to keep the branch graph clean.

Let's imagine how we implement a new feature. Usually, we'll commit multiple times before we reach a satisfactory result, such as some fixes and tests.

However, when we've implemented the feature, those intermediate commits look redundant. So, we may want to squash our commits into one.

Another common scenario where we want to squash commits is merging branches.
